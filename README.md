LPC810-based Capacitance Meter
==============================

Pros:

* Dual-speed measurement
* Auto-ranging
* 1pF to 9999.99uF
* Reasonable precision after stray capacitance subtracted
* Calibration-free for C > 1nF if precision resistors used
* UART output (115200 8N1)
* Compact
* Affordable
* Single-chip, low component count
* SMD-free, prototype-board-friendly layout
* Only uses common components
* Microcontroller can be flashed via UART

Cons:

* May get affected by ESR and leakage
* Measuring frequency not controllable
* 1% error in clock introduced by the microcontroller
* Require relatively new arm-none-eabi toolchain for reasonable binary size
* Time-constant-based approach is not as precise as LCR bridge
* Requires 3.3V power supply
